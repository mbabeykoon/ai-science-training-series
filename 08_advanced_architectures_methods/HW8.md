Among the various applications of AI, I want to use AI for regression. I hope to use a machine learning approach to predict subsurface parameters on the ocean based on sea surface parameters observed by remote sensing methods such as satellites. I hope to use Sea surface temperature, wind stress, and net heat flux data with the longitude and latitude values. I hope to try numerous regression models, such as support vector regressor, to find out which is best for my task. I want to use mean absolute error and coefficient of determination (R2 Score) to evaluate my models.
